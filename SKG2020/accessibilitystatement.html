                        University websites are not fully accessible:</p>

                        <li>Older PDFS and Word documents may not be fully accessible to screen reader software.</li>
                        <li>The colour contrast for some text and some interface components (for example search boxes,
                            check boxes) is not sufficient.</li>
                        <li>Some online forms are not set up correctly to include helpful direction for screen reader
